## Introduction

The app provides an informational page including facts, videos, and photographs about each of 144 different animals. Users can search for an animal, browse all the animals, or get a randomly selected animal. Each animal page offers the user the option to earn a badge for that animal and earn points toward leveling up by answering questions based on the facts provided. New users begin at the "Observer" level and attempt to earn their way up to "Zoologist". Users must register for an account and be logged in to access the app, and a parent account is required in order to register a user account.
